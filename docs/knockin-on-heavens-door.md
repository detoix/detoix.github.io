# Knockin’ on heaven’s door – Bob Dylan

Mama, take this badge from me  `G  D  a7`  
I can't use it anymore  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  

Mama, put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That cold black cloud is comin' down  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  

Knock, knock, knockin' …
