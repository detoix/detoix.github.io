Mama, take this badge from me `G D a7`  
I can't use it anymore `G D a7`  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see `G D C`  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  

>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D C`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  

Mama, put my guns in the ground `G D a7`  
I can't shoot them anymore `G D a7`  
That cold black cloud is comin' down `G D C`  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  

>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D C`  
>Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door `G D a7`
