It's nine o'clock on a Saturday  `C      G          F    C`  
The regular crowd shuffles in  `    F       C              D7  G`   
There's an old man sitting next to me `           C       G       F       C`  
Making love to his tonic and gin `        F           G         C   G `  
 
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory `          C            G         F   C`  
I'm not really sure how it goes `    F          C           D7   G`  
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete `         C            G           F          C`  
When I wore a younger man's clothes." `     F        G             C`  
 
la la la, di da da `a              D7`   
La la, di di da da dum `a           D7    G  F C G7`  
 
>Sing us a song, you're the piano man `C         G                F     C`  
>Sing us a song tonight `F         C      D7   G`  
>Well, we're all in the mood for a melody `            C          G          F   C`  
>And you've got us all feeling alright `    F                 G         C     G`  
 
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine `    C           G        F         C`  
He gets me my drinks for free `   F          C          D7  G`  
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke `         C            G              F             C`  
But there's some place that he'd rather be `            F               G           C   G`  
 
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me." `          C         G             F       C`  
As the smile ran away from his face `       F          C            D7  G`  
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star `          C           G          F     C`  
If I could get out of this place" `   F           G           C`  
 
la la la, di da da `a              D7`   
La la, di di da da dum `a           D7    G  F C G7`  
 
Now Paul is a real estate novelist `    C         G           F   C`  
Who never had time for a wife `    F         C          D7  G`  
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy `         C            G           F            C`  
And probably will be for life `    F             G      C   G`  
 
And the waitress is practicing politics `        C           G          F   C`  
As the businessman slowly gets stoned `       F           C           D7    G`  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness `             C         G               F     C`  
But it's better than drinking alone `         F           G         C    G`  
 
>Sing us a song, you're the piano man `C         G                F     C`

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday `       C           G           F    C`  
And the manager gives me a smile `        F       C          D7    G`  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see `          C               G               F         C`  
To forget about life for a while `   F            G           C   G`  
 
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival `        C         G             F    C`  
And the microphone smells like a beer `        F          C             D7  G`  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar `         C          G           F           C`  
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?" `          F             G         C     G`  
 
la la la, di da da `a              D7`   
La la, di di da da dum `a           D7    G  F C G7`
